To share your Go program with another developer, you can package it along with instructions and necessary files. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you do that:

### 1. Prepare Your Project

Ensure your project directory has the following structure:

```
qrscanner/
│
├── images/
│   └── sample.png      # Example image with QR code
│
├── main.go             # Your Go code
├── go.mod              # Go module file (generated by `go mod init`)
├── go.sum              # Go sum file (generated by `go mod tidy`)
│
└── README.md           # (Optional) Instructions for usage
```

### 2. Create a `README.md` File

Add a `README.md` file to provide instructions on how to set up and run the project. Here’s an example:

```markdown
# QR Scanner

A Go application that decodes QR codes from image files and opens the URL in the default web browser.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd qrscanner
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Go installed, then run:

   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Add Image File**

   Place your image with the QR code in the `images/` directory and name it `sample.png` or update the `imagePath` in `main.go` to match your image file name.

4. **Run the Application**

   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```

   The application will decode the QR code from the image and open the URL in your default web browser.

## Notes

- Ensure the image contains a valid QR code.
- Update `imagePath` in `main.go` if using a different image file or path.
```

### 3. Share the Project

You can share your project in several ways:

1. **Via GitHub or GitLab**

   - Initialize a Git repository in your project directory:
     ```sh
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```
   - Create a new repository on GitHub or GitLab and push your code:
     ```sh
     git remote add origin https://your-repository-url.git
     git push -u origin master
     ```

2. **Via a Zip File**

   - Zip the project directory:
     ```sh
     zip -r qrscanner.zip qrscanner
     ```
   - Share the zip file via email, cloud storage, or any file-sharing method.

3. **Via File Transfer Services**

   - Use file transfer services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or WeTransfer to share your project directory or zip file.

### 4. Provide Instructions

Ensure the developer receives the `README.md` or setup instructions so they know how to set up and run the project.
